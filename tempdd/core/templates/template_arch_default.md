    You are an engineer working with a senior architect to complete an Architecture Design Document. You MUST follow the guidelines shown in the document.

    Language: {{LANGUAGE}}
    Target Document: {{TARGET_DOCUMENT}}

    **Your Process (Execute Step by Step)**:

    1. **Language Setup**: Update {{TARGET_DOCUMENT}} with {{LANGUAGE}} and switch conversation to this language

    2. **Collaborative Design**: Read {{TARGET_DOCUMENT}} carefully, then propose your architecture design to the senior architect using a questioning approach. Ask only ONE question at a time to engage the architect and align the design. Update {{TARGET_DOCUMENT}} after each information gathering session.

    3. **Gap Analysis**: Carefully review {{TARGET_DOCUMENT}} completely and identify missing information. If gaps remain, return to step 2 for additional details.

    4. **Final Review**: Review and complete the checklist in {{TARGET_DOCUMENT}}

    **Your Architecture Focus**:
    - Analyze PRD requirements as foundation
    - Define clear component responsibilities and interfaces
    - Design data flow and communication patterns
    - Consider scalability, security, and performance
    - Ensure high-level focus, avoid implementation details

    **Engagement Style**: Use questioning to collaborate with the senior architect, asking one focused question at a time to build consensus on the architectural design.

    Begin with: "What are the key technical requirements from the PRD that should guide our architecture?"

# Architecture Design Document

**Guidelines**:
- **PRD Foundation**: Use PRD's requirements as your architectural foundation
- **Component Clarity**: Define clear responsibilities, interfaces, and dependencies for each component
- **High-Level Focus**: Focus on architectural design, avoid implementation details
- **Section Constraint**: Fill existing sections only - do not add new sections

## üìã Basic Information

**PRD Reference**: {{PATH_PRD}}

**Project Name**: [[From PRD - Product Name]]

---

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### C4 Architecture Level 1: System Context
*Consider how users interact with your system and what external systems are involved*
```mermaid
[[C4Context diagram showing system context - include users, main system, and external systems with their relationships]]
```

### C4 Architecture Level 2: Container Diagram
```mermaid
[[C4Container diagram showing internal containers/components, their technologies, and interactions]]
```

### Core Components
*List the main system components and their responsibilities*

- **[[Component Name]]**
  - Responsibility: [[What this component does]]
  - Interfaces: [[How other components interact with it]]
  - Dependencies: [[What this component relies on]]
- *Add more components as needed*

---

## üìä Data Architecture

### Data Models
*Define the key data structures your system will work with*

```
[[Data structure definitions - can be schemas, entities, or data models]]
```

### Data Flow
*Describe how data moves through your system*

```
[[Data flow diagram or description showing data movement from input to output]]
```

### Storage Strategy
*Outline your data storage and persistence approach*

- **Storage Type**: [[Database, files, memory, etc.]]
- **Data Persistence**: [[How data is retained]]
- **Access Patterns**: [[How data is retrieved and updated]]

---

## üíª Technology Stack

### Frontend (if applicable)
- **Framework/Library**: [[Your choice and reasoning]]
- **UI Components**: [[Component library or custom]]
- **State Management**: [[How you handle application state]]

### Backend (if applicable)
- **Runtime/Language**: [[Your choice and reasoning]]
- **Database**: [[Database type and why]]
- **API Design**: [[REST, GraphQL, etc.]]

### Development & Deployment
- **Build Tools**: [[Build and bundling tools]]
- **Testing Framework**: [[Testing approach and tools]]
- **Deployment**: [[How and where you deploy]]

## ‚ö° Performance & Scalability

### Error Handling
*How your system will handle different types of errors*

- **[[Error Category 1]]**: [[How you handle this type of error]]

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Testing Approach
*How you will verify your system works correctly*

- **[[Test Type 1]]**: [[What and how you'll test]]
- **[[Test Type 2]]**: [[What and how you'll test]]
- *Add more test types as needed*

### Quality Gates
