description: "Default flow of software development, including PRD, Arch., Research, BluePrint, Tasks stages."
help: |
  1. PRD (Product Requirements Document)
     - Use '/tempdd-go prd build' to create product requirements

  2. Architecture Document
     - Use '/tempdd-go arch build' to design system architecture

  3. Research Document
     - Use '/tempdd-go research build' to conduct technical research

  4. Blueprint Document
     - Use '/tempdd-go blueprint build' to create detailed implementation blueprint

  5. Tasks Document & Implementation
     - Use '/tempdd-go tasks build' to break down implementation tasks
     - Use '/tempdd-go tasks run' to implement the planned tasks

  Stage Actions:
    build - Create/build the document for the stage
    run   - Execute the implementation (for tasks stage)
  
  Each stage builds upon the previous one, creating a structured development workflow from requirements to implementation.
