description: "Simple flow of software development, including PRD, Arch., Tasks stages."
help: |
  1. PRD (Product Requirements Document)
    - Use '/tempdd-go prd build' to create product requirements

  2. Blueprint Document
    - Use '/tempdd-go blueprint build' to create implementation blueprint

  3. Tasks Document & Implementation
    - Use '/tempdd-go tasks build' to break down implementation tasks
    - Use '/tempdd-go tasks run' to implement the planned tasks

  Stage Actions:
    build - Create/build the document for the stage
    run   - Execute the implementation (for tasks stage)
  
  Each stage builds upon the previous one, creating a structured development workflow from requirements to implementation.
